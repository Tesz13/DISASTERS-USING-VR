# Project Disasters — Virtual Reality using Houdini

> A fully procedural, VR-ready sandbox built in **Houdini** that simulates natural (and not-so-natural) chaos — terrains, oceans, floods, clouds, mountains, trees, buildings, asteroids, rain, and destruction FX — all in one dynamic environment.

---

## Overview

This project explores **environmental simulations** and **destruction FX** using **SideFX Houdini**.  
Every element — from island terrain to asteroid impacts — is procedurally generated for full control and creative flexibility.  
Designed with **Virtual Reality (VR)** in mind, it demonstrates how procedural workflows can efficiently create large-scale, realistic worlds.

**Presented by:** *Thanvi Sirla*  
**Date:** December 2023

## Features

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|  **Terrain System** | Procedural island created with heightfields (remap, noise, erosion, water level) |
|  **Water Simulation** | Still ocean, ocean waves, and flood passes driven by *Ocean Spectrum/Evaluate* |
|  **Atmospherics** | Volumetric cloud setup using *Cloud* & *CloudNoise* nodes |
|  **Environment** | Mountains with *UVQuickShade* textures, procedural tree placement |
|  **Built Assets** | Buildings, helipad, and a dynamic name/title card |
|  **FX & Destruction** | RBD Fracture + Bullet Solver, POP simulations for fire, asteroids, and rain |
